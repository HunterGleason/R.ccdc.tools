\title{Plot CCDC  (Zhu & Woodcock 2014) time series sample by polygon.}
\usage{
plot_ccdc_ts_bypoly(
  ccdc_img,
  ccdc_img_date,
  zone_poly,
  catg_col,
  days = 730,
  band,
  N = 60
)
}
\arguments{
\item{ccdc_img}{(SpatRaster,stars) The CCDC image for which to extract coefficients, for one segment only,
such as the output from 'gen_latest_ccdc_rast'.}

\item{ccdc_img_date}{(character) A representation of the CCDC image date that can be interpreted by as.Date()}

\item{zone_poly}{(SpatVector,sf) Polygons for which to plot CCDC time series sample, by category.}

\item{catg_col}{(Character) The name of the column that defines the category of each polygon.}

\item{days}{The number of days for which to plot the CCDC time series, defaults to 730 (2 years)}

\item{band}{band (character) The name of the band for which to extract CCDC coefficients. One of 'blue', 'green', 'red'
'nir', 'swir1','swir2' or 'therm'.}

\item{N}{The number of pixels to sample (and plot) for each category.}
}
\value{
(void) Plots the CCDC time series for a sample of pixels stratified by polygon category.
}
\description{
Provided a CCDC image and a polygon layer with some category field, this function plots a sample
of the pixels with each polygon grouped by category, indicated by the 'catg_col' parameter.
}
